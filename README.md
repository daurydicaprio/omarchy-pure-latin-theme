## 🛠️ Integrated Productivity Tools

This theme is designed to work seamlessly with the following custom scripts:

### [Live Wallpaper Manager for Omarchy](https://github.com/daurydicaprio/live-wallpaper-for-omarchy-linux)
Manage dynamic backgrounds with ease. 
* **Logic:** Follow the sequential numbering rule. If you have 2 static images in /backgrounds/, your first video in /backgrounds/live/ must be named 3-video.mp4.

### [Omarchy Monitor Toggle](https://github.com/daurydicaprio/omarchy-monitor-toggle)
Control your displays and laptop lid behavior for a cleaner workspace.
* **Function:** Provides shortcuts (Super+Ctrl+D/F) to toggle internal/external monitors and handles automatic power management when closing the laptop lid.
